## About

#### I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate at the University of Calgary with a Bachelor's in Science in Computer Science.

After recieving the NSERC award for my proposed VR development project I began working as a researcher at the University of Calgary to utilize virtual realtiy for new user friendly systems. More specifically my project can be seen on my profile which is something I am super excited about and would love to talk about more!

So feel free to reach out to me! I'm always looking for new ideas and projects to talk about. 


In my free time I'm quite the rock climber so I will often go climbing after work hours. ðŸ§—
